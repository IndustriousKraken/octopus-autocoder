## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: `github.fork_owner` opt-in to fork-PR mode
autocoder SHALL accept an optional `github.fork_owner: String` field in
`config.yaml`. When present, autocoder operates in **fork-PR mode** for
all configured repositories: the agent branch is pushed to a fork
owned by `fork_owner`, and PRs are opened as cross-repository PRs from
the fork to the upstream. When absent, autocoder operates in
**direct-push mode** with no behavior change from the prior
implementation.

#### Scenario: `fork_owner` absent — direct-push mode
- **WHEN** `config.yaml` has no `github.fork_owner` key
- **THEN** every configured repository operates in direct-push mode:
  the agent branch is pushed to `origin` and PRs use the agent-branch
  name as the `head` parameter
- **AND** no `fork` remote is registered in any workspace

#### Scenario: `fork_owner` present — fork-PR mode active
- **WHEN** `config.yaml` has `github.fork_owner: <handle>` set
- **THEN** every configured repository operates in fork-PR mode: the
  agent branch is pushed to the `fork` remote (pointing at
  `git@github.com:<handle>/<repo>.git` or the HTTPS equivalent), and
  PRs are opened with `head: "<handle>:<agent-branch>"` against the
  upstream repository

#### Scenario: `fork_owner` is global, not per-repository
- **WHEN** `config.yaml` has `github.fork_owner: <handle>` set
- **THEN** the same `<handle>` is used as the fork owner for every
  configured repository
- **AND** per-repository fork-owner overrides are NOT supported

### Requirement: Startup verification of fork existence
When `github.fork_owner` is set, autocoder SHALL verify that each
configured repository has a corresponding fork at the expected URL
before spawning any polling task. A missing fork SHALL cause autocoder
to exit non-zero at startup, with an error naming both the upstream
URL and the expected fork URL.

#### Scenario: Fork exists and is reachable
- **WHEN** autocoder starts with `github.fork_owner` set AND every
  configured repository's derived fork URL resolves via
  `git ls-remote <fork-url> HEAD`
- **THEN** all polling tasks are spawned and the daemon enters its
  normal polling state
- **AND** no fork-existence-related output appears beyond the per-repo
  startup log lines

#### Scenario: Fork is missing or unreachable
- **WHEN** autocoder starts with `github.fork_owner` set AND at least
  one configured repository's derived fork URL fails the
  `git ls-remote` probe (404, auth failure, network error)
- **THEN** autocoder aggregates per-repo failures into a single error
  message naming each upstream URL and its expected fork URL
- **AND** autocoder exits non-zero before spawning any polling task
- **AND** the stderr/log message instructs the operator to verify the
  fork exists under `fork_owner` and that the autocoder user has SSH
  access to it

### Requirement: Rewind --hard targets fork remote in fork-PR mode
autocoder SHALL delete the agent branch from the `fork` remote (not
`origin`) when `rewind` is invoked with `--hard` AND
`github.fork_owner` is set. The local-branch deletion semantics are
unchanged.

#### Scenario: Hard rewind in fork-PR mode
- **WHEN** the operator runs `autocoder rewind <change> --hard` AND
  `github.fork_owner` is set
- **THEN** the manager runs
  `git push fork --delete <agent_branch>` instead of
  `git push origin --delete <agent_branch>`
- **AND** the local branch is deleted via `git branch -D <agent_branch>`
  as in direct-push mode
- **AND** failures of the remote delete are logged but non-blocking,
  as in direct-push mode

#### Scenario: Soft rewind in fork-PR mode
- **WHEN** the operator runs `autocoder rewind <change>` (no `--hard`)
  AND `github.fork_owner` is set
- **THEN** the manager deletes only the local branch; neither remote
  is touched
- **AND** the resulting fork's agent branch is left intact for the
  next polling pass to force-push over
