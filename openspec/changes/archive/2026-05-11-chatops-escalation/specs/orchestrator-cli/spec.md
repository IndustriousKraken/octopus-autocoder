## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Daemon entry point
The orchestrator SHALL provide a `run` subcommand that loads a YAML configuration file and starts an asynchronous polling loop for each configured repository, terminating only on signal (SIGINT/SIGTERM) or fatal initialization error. **In each polling iteration, the orchestrator SHALL process waiting (escalated) changes BEFORE pending (fresh) changes. If after the waiting-processing step ANY change in the same repository is still waiting, the orchestrator SHALL skip the pending-change loop for that iteration. This preserves the architecture's serial-queue invariant — pending changes are not processed while an earlier-or-equal change is unresolved.**

#### Scenario: Iteration processes waiting changes before pending
- **WHEN** a polling iteration begins for a repository
- **THEN** the orchestrator first calls `queue::list_waiting(workspace)` and processes each waiting change in order
- **AND** only after all waiting changes have been processed does the orchestrator call `queue::list_pending(workspace)` and process pending changes

#### Scenario: Resuming a change after an answer arrives
- **WHEN** the orchestrator processes a waiting change AND `chatops_manager.poll_thread_for_human_reply` returns `Some(reply)`
- **THEN** the orchestrator (in this exact order) writes `.answer.json` containing the reply, reads `resume_handle` from `.question.json`, deletes `.question.json`, calls `executor.resume(resume_handle, &reply.text)`, and on any returned outcome deletes `.answer.json`
- **AND** the resumed call's outcome is handled identically to a fresh `executor.run` outcome: `Completed` ⇒ commit (if diff exists) and archive; `AskUser` ⇒ post a new question and write a fresh `.question.json` (after deleting `.answer.json`); `Failed` ⇒ log the reason naming the change

#### Scenario: Initial AskUser handling during pending iteration
- **WHEN** `executor.run` returns `Ok(ExecutorOutcome::AskUser { question, resume_handle })` during a pending-change iteration
- **THEN** the orchestrator calls `chatops_manager.post_question(channel, change, &question)` to obtain `thread_ts`, then writes `.question.json` containing the `thread_ts`, channel id, `resume_handle`, and current RFC3339 timestamp under key `asked_at`
- **AND** the orchestrator unlocks the change by removing `.in-progress`
- **AND** the change is NOT archived; it remains in the workspace and is enumerated by `list_waiting` on subsequent iterations
- **AND** the orchestrator proceeds to the next pending change

#### Scenario: Channel resolution per change
- **WHEN** the orchestrator needs the Slack channel id for a change
- **THEN** the orchestrator uses `repository.slack_channel_id` if set on the per-repo config
- **AND** otherwise uses `slack.default_channel_id` from the global config
- **AND** if neither is set, the AskUser handling fails with an error naming the missing config key

#### Scenario: Polling iteration does not block on a stuck waiting change
- **WHEN** a waiting change has not received a human reply
- **THEN** the iteration's processing of that change completes within one Slack polling round-trip (no internal sleep or retry loop)
- **AND** other waiting changes in the same repo continue to be polled in the same iteration

#### Scenario: Same-repo queue blocking when a change is still waiting
- **WHEN** an iteration completes the waiting-processing step AND `queue::list_waiting(workspace)` still returns a non-empty list
- **THEN** the orchestrator SHALL NOT call `queue::list_pending(workspace)` for that repository in this iteration
- **AND** the iteration emits a single log line of the form `"queue blocked for <url>: <N> change(s) still waiting on human reply"` listing the names
- **AND** other repositories' polling tasks are unaffected (cross-repo blocking is not implied)
- **AND** the iteration proceeds to its sleep step normally so a future iteration can re-check Slack

#### Scenario: Queue resumes after waiting set empties
- **WHEN** an iteration completes the waiting-processing step AND every previously-waiting change has either resumed-to-completion (archived) or resumed-to-Failed (returned to pending) AND `queue::list_waiting(workspace)` is now empty
- **THEN** the orchestrator proceeds to the pending-change loop in the same iteration
- **AND** any pending changes that were blocked in earlier iterations are eligible for processing now
